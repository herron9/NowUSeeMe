BUG:
This program cannot recognize STRING which contains ' in its body.
For example : 'abc'defg'
Expected result:abc'defg
when it comes to this condition, the program may result in unexpected token.

There are two failed tests, t1 and towers.

For this two case, the compiler yields correct results but the PRINT function fail to output the last ¡°\n¡± in both results.Currently I can¡¯t find why it doesn¡¯t work.
